Hi everyone, my name is LuÃ­s Gustavo, and this git repo is for the usage of Santa Bot, which is handled through Heroku to run the whole application 24/7.

The main idea came when I, as a League of Legends player, got kind of stressed when I was at champion select, and faced a hard-to-counter champion (specially
when I was off role) and had to go through all the steps of typing "op.gg", champion stats bar, typing the champion I was against, etc... This process takes so long,
and most of times, you don't have all this time to pick the champion while in champion select. Then, when I was studying Web Scraping and also watched a video about how
to create Bots on Discord using Python, I had the idea of making eveything so simpler, by linking these two ideas. Why not creating a Bot in Discord for LoL players, since
almost every player uses Discord?

The Bot uses the op.gg domain to look for the three best counter champions, not taking too much time to return the required information.

Additionally, as a disclaimer, my intention was never to make money out of the op.gg Website, it was just a project I came up with to show my coding skills, since op.gg also
uses Riot Games API to look for all the data, which is free.
